# About neural-networks stack

# neural-networks stack
Template for Neural Networks using TensorFlow

## Objective
* This stack is focused the template for the first steps with neural networks development.
* All the steps will be load from the template. All you need to train, test and validade alghoritm will be loaded.
* Is important to setup your epochs number accondingly with your project.
* The fit, evaluate and predict model will be ready to go as soon as you import the stack.
